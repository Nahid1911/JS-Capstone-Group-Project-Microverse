<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

> **Clone the repository:** Start by cloning our GitHub repository to your local machine using the Git command git clone <repository-url>.
> **Install dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running npm install.

### Prerequisites

**Node.js:** Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine. You can download the latest version from the official Node.js website and follow the installation instructions.

**webpack:** Ensure that webpack is installed on your machine. You can install from the guideline in the official website of webpack.


### Setup

**API Integration:** If our website relies on external APIs, make sure you have the required API keys or credentials. Update the relevant API configuration files or environment variables.

### Usage
**Development Mode:** To run the website in development mode, use the command "npm run dev". This will start the development server and enable hot-reloading, allowing you to view changes instantly as you edit the code.
**Production Build:** When you are ready to build the production-ready version of the website, run the command "npm run build". This will generate the optimized and minified assets in the dist or build directory.
**Start the Server:** To start the production server and serve the built assets, use the command "npm start".

### Run tests

**Testing Framework:** If our project includes tests, make sure you have the necessary testing framework (e.g., Jest) installed globally or as a project dependency.
**Test Execution:** Use the command "npm test" to run the tests and verify the functionality of the website. The test results will be displayed in the terminal.

You can also use the following command.

```sh
  npm install --save-dev jest
  npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs
  npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom
  npm install jquery
  npm install --save-dev identity-obj-proxy
  npm test
```

### Deployment

**Hosting Platform:** Choose a hosting platform that suits your needs (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Netlify).
**Deployment Configuration:** Set up the deployment configuration, such as configuring the server, environment variables, and build commands.
**Deployment Process:** Follow the hosting platform's documentation to deploy your website. This may involve connecting the repository, specifying the deployment branch, and triggering the deployment process.
